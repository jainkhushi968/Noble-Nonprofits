# Noble-Nonprofits
Noble Nonprofits Project Repository 
It is a project aimed at bringing together NEARBY AUTHENTIC Non-profit organizations (Orphanages, old age homes, NGOs etc.) on a single platform to the Donors/Volunteers for donations and volunteering experience. 
It allows people to search for various Non-profit organizations and get their details all on a single website.
Moreover they can even look for various Volunteer positions available in the registered organizations and can apply for the same as per requirement.
It is also a hassle free run for Non profit organizations to advertise about themselves and keep a track of all the applications they are getting for Volunteer experience from people across the country and the same goes for the other end of users.
